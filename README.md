# RESTinForm Frontend Side
Frontend side for app hosted in https://restinform.herokuapp.com

HTML, CSS, JQuery with Ajax Requests
The frontend talks to:
- the Facebook Graph API through Facebook Javascript SDK in order to authenticate a user and gather his first name, his current location and his profile image.
- the Director through an Ajax request with a jsonp parameter in order to enable cross-domain requests.
- to DBService in order to store weight and height inserted a user.
