# RESTinForm Frontend Side
Frontend side for app hosted in [http://188.226.183.46](http://188.226.183.46)

HTML, CSS, JQuery with Ajax Requests.
The frontend talks to:
- the Facebook Graph API through Facebook Javascript SDK in order to authenticate a user and gather his first name, his current location and his profile image.
- the Director through an Ajax request with a jsonp parameter in order to enable cross-domain requests.
- to DBService in order to store weight and height inserted a user.

The frontend send an HTTP Request to the director. While the `callback=?` parameter means that we are using a jsonp with a random callback generated by jQuery, the `token` parameter is used to authenticate a user with Facebook.

```
GET http://188.226.183.46:9091/project-director/weather?callback=?&token=<TOKEN>
```
When the request come back to the frontend side, the result is a JSON Object with the following structure:
```
{"result": [{<activityplan1>,<activityplan2>,<activityplan3>}]}
```
Each `activityplan` is a JSON Object that contains a plan for a day.
An example of output is the following:
```
{  
   "result":[  
      {  
         "activityplan":{  
            "bmirange":2,
            "idphrase":4,
            "change":2,
            "phrase":"poppa333",
            "weathertype":1,
            "activity":"ciao"
         },
         "weather":{  
            "location":"Trento, Italy",
            "temp":-4.8,
            "weather":"Clear",
            "type":1
         }
      },
      {  
         "activityplan":{  
            "bmirange":2,
            "idphrase":4,
            "change":2,
            "phrase":"poppa333",
            "weathertype":1,
            "activity":"ciao"
         },
         "weather":{  
            "location":"Trento, Italy",
            "temp":-6.28,
            "weather":"Clear",

            "idphrase":4,
            "change":2,
            "phrase":"poppa333",
            "weathertype":1,
            "activity":"ciao"
         },
